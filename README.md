# MicroMalaria

This repository was created to host the required files for a novel in-vitro RF system, which is used to expose contaminated blood samples to high-power radiofrequency signals. The system comprises a RF applicator, a RF generator, a power amplifier and the control system. The RF applicator dimensions were first obtained from (Microwave Exposure System for In Vitro and In Vivo Studies, 10.13140/2.1.2922.7843) but later modified. The generator is based on a MAX2870 IC and the power amplifier is a sky66292-11. The software for the control system relies on a LabVIEW-based GUI and an Arduino for I/O control.

The board schematics are also presented here, as well as the gerber files.
